# React-Control
## Why another router of react?
&emsp;&emsp;In React system, router should not only be a router, React needs more.
He needs router, he needs filter, if in mobile environment, he will needs supports of multiple pages, and he may need animation to initialize a page.

&emsp;&emsp;<strong>Not a router, more than router.</strong>

## He did
* Intensive Router
  * Router configures in React's way(Just like React-Router).
  * Supports muilti pages at a time.
  * Supports abstract router(Which cannot be activeted by URL).
* Filter
  * Filter queue before mount a component.
  * Filter queue before unmount a component.
* Small Component Use in React
  * Which leads React to fit flexible projects.
* Else
  * Animation to initialize a page.
  * Render in server side.
